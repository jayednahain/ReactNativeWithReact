# Todo 

# Filter

### //3.3-1 (TOGGLED)
we want to change a single todo
currently we are getting a single id from a single todo
so from existing data we need to find which object we need to change


### //3.3-2 (COLORSELECTED)
update the color


### //3.3-2 
// if we found that id the remove it
// return the whole list except that id

### //3.3-3 complete 
// all task (including complete/incomplete)

### //3.3-4 find the items which are not complete
//if the item is not completed then complete
// here we are returning / getting those items which are not complete
// filtering the items which are not completed
// so incomplete items will be will ignored
