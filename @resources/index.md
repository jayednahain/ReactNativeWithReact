- #28 CLASS VS HOOKS
    - 
- #31 setState and shallow Marge
    - setState shallow marge to the current state object 
    - shallow will look for any key that exist in the current state object. and update with new value
- #32 setState and secondary callback
    - (#32-1)
    - setState in asynchronous call
    - console log synchronous call
        - when console log is called the state might not be updated
    - (#32-2) stateState takes two different argument
    - (#32-3) in 1st parameter we can update state using returning
        - 2nd parameter callback will run after update the state
    - (#32-4) we can state inside , 1st argument callback parameter
- (#37) Life cycle method componentDidMount
    - componentDidMount
        - mounting is the frist time a componenet gets placed into DOM
        - so the first time react renders a component into the page is mounting
        - it only happens once
        - its specially used on api calling
- (#39) renders and re-renders react
    - life cycle
        - 1. constructor() run first
            - we initialize states on constructor
        - 2. render() runs then
            - renders determine what to show
        - 3. componentDidMount() runs next
    - after consoling with life cycle we see render method runs twice
        - the moment need to changes state , we called setState
            - react knows this component is different i need to re-render
        -  
- (#44) - 
- (#57) - pure and impure function
    - pure function
        - return exect same things when its given a same argument
    - impure function
        -  if its modify or relay on something out side of its scope
            -  functional component will create impure functionality
