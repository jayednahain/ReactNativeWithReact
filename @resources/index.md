# Todo 

# Filter

### //3.3-1 (TOGGLED)
- we want to change a single todo
- currently we are getting a single id from a single todo
- so from existing data we need to find which object we need to change


### //3.3-2 (COLORSELECTED)
- update the color


### //3.3-2 
- if we found that id the remove it
- return the whole list except that id

### //3.3-3 complete 
- all task (including complete/incomplete)

### //3.3-4 find the items which are not complete
- if the item is not completed then complete
- here we are returning / getting those items which are not complete
- filtering the items which are not completed
- so incomplete items will be will ignored


### //3.4-1
