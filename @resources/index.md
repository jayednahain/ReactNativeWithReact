Web: The position property in web development can have values like static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky.

 React Native, for example, uses position: 'relative' and position: 'absolute' to control positioning. The concept of a fixed position is achieved using position: 'absolute' in combination with specific coordinates.

# positioning
### static
- by default positions stays static
### relative
- takes the element out of the document flow
- no longer works as a statically positions
- 
### absolute
- not work freely
- it always depends on parents
- position absolute works as a guest 
- if position absolute is guest in a apartment ! the owner of the apartment must be relative / position fix,
- absolute position absolutely positions, with the parent container that it can reference 

# Layouts
1. Proximity 
- make sure relative items groups together
2. white space
- gives content room for breath
3. Alignment
- 
4. contrast
- 
5. Repetition

# Flex
- The flex property in React Native combines flexGrow, flexShrink, and flexBasis.
## FlexGrow
- how to deal with extra spaces
